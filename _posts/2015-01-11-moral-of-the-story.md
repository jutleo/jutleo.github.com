在Quora上看到一个这样的小故事，摘出来写给自己。
<!-- more -->

Jack and Max are walking to the church, to pray.

Jack wonders whether it would be alright to smoke while praying.
Max replies, “Why don’t you ask the Priest?”

So Jack goes up to the Priest and asks, “Father, may I smoke while I pray?”

The Priest replies, “No, my son, you may not! That’s utter disrespect to our religion.”

Jack goes back to his friend and tells him what the good Priest told him.
Max says, “I’m not surprised. You asked the wrong question. Let me try.”

And so Max goes up to the Priest and asks,
“Father, may I pray while I smoke?”

To which the Priest eagerly replies, “By all means, my son. By all means. You can always pray whenever you want to.”

Moral of the story: The approval you want depends on the way you ask for it.
